# Solana and Rust dApp Project: Share Daft Punk GIFs

Based on a [buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) project where I learned and created with Solana and Rust. Wrote and deployed a Solana program that connects to a React web3 app that anyone with a Solana wallet can interact with.

Web3 client available at [gif-portal-starter.emtr0.repl.co](https://gif-portal-starter.emtr0.repl.co/).

Connect your wallet and share your favorite Daft Punk GIFs!
